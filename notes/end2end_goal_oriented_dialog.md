# Paper

- Learning End-To-End Goal-Oriented Dialog (2017)


# Note

- The authors compared rule-based system, TF-IDF match, nearest neighbor, supervised embedding model, and memory network for goal-orient dialog.
- Rule-based system did best in the closed environment.
- Memory network performed well for more realistic dialog.


# Thoughts

- I just skimmed through this paper.
